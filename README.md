### lore

In the year 2157, humanity's constant push to find new homes in space led to a massive war.
Earth's governments joined together to form the Alliance, sending soldiers across the galaxy to take over planets that could support human life.
You were one of these soldiers, fighting in many battles and becoming very skilled at combat.
However, you began to question whether taking these planets by force was right.
When you refused to attack a peaceful alien settlement, the Alliance arrested you and threw you in prison along with other soldiers who had similar doubts.

The Alliance then came up with a new plan: they would use prisoners as colonizers, forcing them to settle on distant planets instead of wasting the lives of loyal soldiers.
You and hundreds of other prisoners were loaded onto huge colony ships and put into cryosleep - a deep frozen sleep that lets humans survive long space journeys.
Your ship was headed to a planet called Nova-6, which the Alliance claimed was empty and perfect for human life. What they didn't tell you was that they had lied about their scans of Nova-6.
The planet was actually home to an advanced alien civilization called the Keth'ara, who had been watching human ships get closer to their world for months.
As your colony ship entered their space, the Keth'ara attacked with powerful weapons, breaking through the ship's defenses and severely damaging it.
Your cryosleep pod was damaged in the attack, and you wake up alone in the broken ship.
The sounds of distant gunfire and screaming tell you that someone - or something - is aboard, taking whatever they can from the ruined colony ship.
