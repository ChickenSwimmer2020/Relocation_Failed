### Lore

It was the year 2157, and humanity's constant push to find new homes in space led to a massive war.
Earth's governments joined to form the Alliance, sending soldiers across the galaxy to take over planets that could support human life.
You were one of these soldiers, fighting many battles and becoming skilled at combat.
However, you began questioning whether taking these planets by force was right.
When you refused to attack a peaceful alien settlement, the Alliance arrested you and threw you in prison along with other soldiers who had similar doubts.

The Alliance then devised a new plan: use prisoners as colonizers, forcing them to settle on distant planets instead of wasting the lives of loyal soldiers.
You and hundreds of other prisoners were loaded onto huge colony ships and put into cryosleep - a deep frozen sleep that lets humans survive long space journeys.
Your ship was headed to a planet called Nova-6, which the Alliance claimed was empty and perfect for human life. They didn't tell you they had lied about their scans of Nova-6.
The planet was home to an advanced alien civilization called the Keth'ara, who had been watching human ships get closer to their world for months.
As your colony ship entered its space, the Keth'ara attacked with powerful weapons, breaking through the ship's defenses and severely damaging it.
Your cryosleep pod was damaged in the attack, and you wake up alone in the broken ship.
The sounds of distant gunfire and screaming tell you that someone - or something - is aboard, taking whatever they can from the ruined colony ship.
