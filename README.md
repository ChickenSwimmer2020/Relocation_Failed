### lore

You were a soldier, top of your class. best of the best, but sadly your side lost the intergalactic war of 2041. leading to you becoming a convict in the new world.
you were sent away on the LZ-441 Ghs class interstellar vessel with the task of collonizing a far off planet. you were then put in cryosleep. when you awake, alarms are blaring, and smoke is filling your room.
all you know is that you hear no humans, alarms, and hear the chittering and chattering of aliens. maybe your combat experience will come in handy after all...
