beat -- sections or places where stuff happens

beats can be moved between using the "->" syntax

characters -- easily defined like this
```loreline
character barista
   name: Alex
   friendship: 0  // Track relationship with player
   shiftStarted: true
```
which can speak through the identifier, ex:
```loreline
barista: Welcome to Coffee Dreams! What can I get you today?
```

story text can be written by simply typing it out, no custom identifiers.

tags can be used to modify text display, or show more emotion depending on engine capabilities example: <tag>

state, remains persistant throughout the story
```loreline
state
  coffeeBeans: 100 // Track inventory
  rushHour: false  // Is it busy?
  dayNumber: 1     // Which day of the story
```
these values can also be changed directly
```loreline
     coffeeBeans -= 10  // Use some beans
     rushHour = true    // Start rush hour
     dayNumber += 1     // Move to next day
```
temporary states can be created by using new before a state declaration within a beat.

choices.
```loreline
beat OrderDrink
choice
  Order a cappuccino
    coffeeBeans -= 15
    barista: <happy> One cappuccino coming right up!
    -> PrepareDrink
  Ask about tea options
    barista: We have a lovely selection of green and herbal teas.
    -> TeaMenu
  Just browse the menu
    You take your time reading through the extensive drink list.
    -> DrinkMenu
```
which can also be conditional
```loreline
beat SpecialMenu
     choice
       Order special roast if coffeeBeans >= 20
         coffeeBeans -= 20
         barista: Excellent choice! Our Ethiopian blend is amazing.
         -> PrepareDrink
       Chat with barista if barista.friendship > 2
         barista: <friendly> Want to hear about my coffee journey?
         -> BaristaChat
```
dynamic text is possible, exactly how you would do varible interpolation in normal strings.

characters also can do varible interpolation with there namespace varible, which will show as their name within the dialoug

comments are exactly like haxe, two forward slashes and then commented text, multiline comments are also supported.
